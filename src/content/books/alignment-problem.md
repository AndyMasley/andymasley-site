Brian Christian does something genuinely difficult here: he makes technical AI safety research accessible without dumbing it down. The book traces the history of AI alignment concerns from early cybernetics through to modern deep learning, and he's clearly done his homework.

The best chapters are on reward hacking and specification gaming. Christian has a gift for finding vivid examples that illustrate abstract problems. The AI that learns to pause the game instead of completing levels (because pausing prevents losing) is perfect for explaining why "optimizing for the wrong thing" is such a persistent problem.

Where the book is weaker is in its treatment of solutions. Christian is good at explaining the problems, but the sections on potential fixes feel less compelling. That might just reflect the state of the field—we understand the problems better than we understand how to solve them.

Still, if you want one book to understand why smart people worry about AI alignment, this is probably it. It's rigorous enough to be useful without requiring a technical background.
