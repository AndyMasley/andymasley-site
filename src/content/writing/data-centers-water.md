The headlines are dramatic: *"AI is draining our water supply!"* *"Data centers consume billions of gallons!"* But when you actually look at the numbers, a different picture emerges.

## The real numbers

Golf courses in the United States consume approximately 2.08 billion gallons of water per day. That's 759 billion gallons per year, just to keep grass green for a sport played by a small fraction of the population.

Meanwhile, all data centers in the US—not just AI facilities, but every server running every website, email service, and cloud application—use about 174 billion gallons per year. 

That's less than a quarter of what we use on golf courses.

## Consumptive vs. non-consumptive use

Here's where it gets interesting. When we talk about water "consumption," we need to distinguish between two types:

1. **Consumptive use**: Water that evaporates or is otherwise removed from the local water cycle
2. **Non-consumptive use**: Water that's used and returned to the source

Most data center water use is for cooling, and modern facilities are increasingly using non-consumptive methods. The water isn't disappearing—it's cycling through cooling systems and being returned.

## The efficiency argument

Consider the economic value generated per gallon of water used:

- Golf courses: roughly $0.05 per gallon (greens fees, club memberships)
- Data centers: roughly $2.50 per gallon (cloud services, AI applications)

The economic productivity difference is staggering. Data centers generate 50x more economic value per unit of water than golf courses.

## What this means

I'm not arguing that data center water use is irrelevant, or that we shouldn't work to reduce it. We should. But the current discourse treats AI data centers as uniquely problematic when they're actually remarkably efficient compared to many other industries.

The real question isn't "are data centers using water?" It's "what's the most productive use of our water resources?" And by that metric, data centers look pretty good.
