Stalker is less a science fiction film than a meditation on faith, desire, and the nature of hope. The premise—a guide leading two men through a mysterious "Zone" to a room that grants wishes—is almost beside the point. What matters is the journey and the conversations along the way.

Tarkovsky shoots everything in painterly long takes that force you to actually look at the world. The famous sepia-to-color transition as they enter the Zone is still stunning, even knowing it's coming. Every frame could hang in a gallery.

The ending is the key. After all that journey, all that talk about what they'll wish for, none of them enters the room. The Writer and the Professor have talked themselves out of believing in their own desires. The Stalker's faith is shaken by their cynicism. Is this a tragedy? A commentary on intellectualism? Tarkovsky doesn't say.

At 2 hours 40 minutes, it demands patience. But if you give it your attention, it repays it many times over. This is cinema as spiritual practice.
