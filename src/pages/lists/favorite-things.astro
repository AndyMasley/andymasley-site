        <div class="quote">
          <p>I am not interested in erecting a building but in having the foundations of possible buildings transparently before me. [...] If the place I want to reach could only be climbed up to by a ladder, I would give up trying to get there. For the place to which I really have to go is one that I must actually be at already. Anything that can be reached with a ladder does not interest me. [...] You must climb down to the sources to see them all side by side, the disregarded & the preferred.</p>
          <span class="attribution">— Wittgenstein</span>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>This capability, seen from the human and animal side, calls for the gradual formation of an interdependent world in which all species will enjoy cooperative and mutually supportive relations with one another. Nature is not that way and has never been. So it calls, in a very general way, for the gradual supplanting of the natural by the just.</p>

        <div class="quote">
          <p>The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.</p>
          <span class="attribution">— Italo Calvino</span>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>There are only two true things: intelligent religion and youthful love, which is to say the future and the present. The rest is not worth the trouble.</p>
          <span class="attribution">— François-René de Chateaubriand</span>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>It is, therefore, a great source of virtue for the practiced mind to learn, bit by bit, first to change about in visible and transitory things, so that afterwards it may be possible to leave them behind altogether. The man who finds his homeland sweet is still a tender beginner; he to whom every soil is as his native one is already strong; but he is perfect to whom the entire world is as a foreign land. The tender soul has fixed his love on one spot in the world; the strong man has extended his love to all places; the perfect man has extinguished his. From boyhood I have dwelt on foreign soil and I know with what grief sometimes the mind takes leave of the narrow hearth of a peasant's hut, and I know too how frankly it afterwards disdains marble firesides and panelled halls.</p>
          <span class="attribution">— Hugh of Saint Victor</span>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>Familiar words, easy to take for granted; easy to misconstrue . . . This idea of the pursuit of happiness is at the heart of the civilization to so many outside it or on the periphery. I find it marvelous to contemplate to what an extent, after two centuries, and after the terrible history of the earlier part of this century, the idea has come to a kind of fruition. It is an elastic idea; it fits all men. It implies a certain kind of society, a certain kind of awakened spirit. So much is contained in it: the idea of the individual, responsibility, choice, the life of the intellect, the idea of vocation and perfectibility and achievement. It is an immense human idea. It cannot be reduced to a fixed system. It cannot generate fanaticism. But it is known to exist; and because of that, other more rigid systems in the end blow away.</p>
          <span class="attribution">— V.S. Naipaul</span>

    <div class="category" data-category="ideas">
      <button class="category-title">Simple guiding ideas</button>
      <div class="category-content">
        <ul>
          <li>The laws of physics are not violated.</li>
          <li>Mental functionalism is probably true.</li>
          <li>Many animals probably have first-person experiences in the same way we do. Humans are most likely a tiny tiny minority of conscious minds.</li>
          <li>A lot of what we do is motivated by social status, and that's okay, because social status is more like a language or currency we use to live together, and can often be positive-sum, and this doesn't mean we're all isolated egoists. In fact...</li>
          <li>Psychological and ethical egoism are both incorrect, for hard-nosed realistic reasons rather than wishy washy reasons.</li>
          <li>A lot of the ways people get stuck in life is discovering a very local maximum of social status, where after the negative status hit of moving off of that little hill becomes too painful to consider. The people who feel most alive are the ones who can comfortably step off these hills.</li>
          <li>Markets communicate complex information and translate that into incentives, even if no one involved is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">homo economicus</a>. A lot of the "planning" of what society is like is happening outside of human brains.</li>
          <li>Free reasonable people will arrive at conflicting visions of the good life. We can either build institutions which allow for and mediate this deep value pluralism, or squash freedom. No third option. The state is important as a tool to mediate the potential for violence that comes from pluralistic values. Giving specific institutions this power to mediate is necessary to preserve pluralism, and does not need to be elitist.</li>
          <li>Almost everyone can be getting a big question wrong.</li>
          <li>Surprisingly few people are thinking super hard about their careers or doing simple cost-benefit calculations about different decisions.</li>
          <li>Surprisingly few people are interested in doing middle school-level math, even if it'd help them a lot. My series on why AI isn't bad for the environment built me a big audience because I was doing the relatively simple calculations that seemed to be missing from the discourse.</li>
          <li>Mostly don't do drugs or other addictive stuff. Your entire experience of the whole world, the potential for all future good things to happen from your perspective, in some sense depends on your brain continuing to work well and not becoming brittle to new things.</li>
          <li>The two big events in human history were the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. A third might be coming...</li>
          <li>Resentment of success and competence is a better explainer for a lot of behavior than I used to think. Malevolence too. A lot more of the world is positive-sum than I used to think too. There's a lot more simple kindness and care than I used to think. There's just a lot more of everything. Reality has a surprising amount of detail.</li>
          <li>The labor theory of value is incorrect. A lot of people have a simple folk labor theory of value in their heads that leads to bad misunderstandings of the world.</li>
          <li>Almost everyone seems to have this psychological bias where it's hard for them not to think that the 20 closest people to them are representative of the whole world. Everyone has a superego floating around behind them judging social situations and other people as well as themselves, that they believe is representative of the attitudes of the world more broadly. It rarely is.</li>
          <li>The market is not pricing in a lot of the very most important things, so charity to the right places is deathly important.</li>
          <li>A lot of people are pretty desperately hungry for real deep conversational company with others where it feels like they're getting their head above water for a bit. Learning to give and get that company is important and hard but is basically one of the single best things that can happen. The world is much more lonely than I used to think. Avoiding that and building a real community where you feel deep company takes lots of diligence and care in how you live. Looking back I'm very very grateful that my younger self chose to be so careful in pursuit of this goal.</li>
          <li>The meaning of life is reliably love.</li>
          <li>Avoid the naturalistic fallacy.</li>
          <li>We have a lot of mental blocks around the idea of extreme suffering and your worldview should probably take it more seriously as a problem.</li>
          <li>Condemnation of anyone getting their hands dirty in complex ethical decisions (this comes up a lot in discussions about war) is evil. Extreme pacifism is one bad manifestation of this. There should be no special points for sitting on the sidelines and allowing terrible things to happen. A big reason we're not currently living in a global political hellscape is complex and often fraught decisions made during World War 2. The world could get really really really bad.</li>
          <li>The recent past was probably worse than you think.</li>
