      <p>
        I'm Andy Masley. I run <a href="https://effectivealtruismdc.org">Effective Altruism DC</a>, 
        where I support the professional EA network in Washington and manage projects aimed at 
        doing the most good. I also write and research independently, with funding from Open Philanthropy, 
        focusing on AI policy and challenging conventional narratives through data-driven analysis.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Before this, I was a high school physics teacher for seven years. I created animated video 
        lectures for the full two-year IB Physics curriculum, which you can find on 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP_OGrNktHPMW4LSct_lQYQ">my YouTube channel</a>. 
        The <a href="/physics">IB Physics archive</a> has all my teaching resources.
      </p>

      <h2>What I write about</h2>
      
      <p>
        My writing tends toward the contrarian—I'm drawn to cases where the data contradicts 
        popular narratives. Recent focuses include data center water consumption, AI policy, 
        and the intersection of technology and environmental concerns. I try to be rigorous 
        about sources and transparent about uncertainty.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I publish most of my writing on <a href="https://substack.com/@andymasley">Substack</a> 
        (The Weird Turn Pro), though longer or more reference-oriented pieces live here.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond work</h2>
      
      <p>
        I spend a lot of time with friends, reading, watching movies, and listening to music. 
        Musically, I gravitate toward experimental and noise rock—the weirder the better. 
        I've been experimenting with AI music generation lately, trying to get Suno to produce 
        something genuinely interesting.

      <h2>This site</h2>
      
      <p>
        I built this site to be a Scaruffi-style accumulation of everything I find interesting. 
        It's organized by type—<a href="/writing">writing</a>, <a href="/music">music</a>, 
        <a href="/film">film</a>, <a href="/books">books</a>, <a href="/notes">notes</a>—but 
        everything is cross-linked and searchable. The goal is for it to grow indefinitely.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The site is built with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> and hosted on Netlify. 
        It loads fast, has no trackers, and works without JavaScript (mostly).
      </p>
